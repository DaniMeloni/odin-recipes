        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>
            <li> Beef Sirloin</li>  
            <li>Lots of onion</li> 
            <li>Garlix</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>
            <li>Chop the onions finely</li>
            <li>Remove the tendons from the beef and beat it with a meat tenderizer until as flat as possible</li>
            <li>Cover meat on both sides with the chopped onion and leave for 30 minutes or more. Remove the onion and add salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Cook the steak to your preference(most would prefer medium-rare). Remove from heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan and fry the onion used for the beef until it changes color. 
                Adjust the flavor with salt and pepper, then move the onion to the steak.</li>
            <li>Melt the remaining butter in the frying pan and fry the sides of the meat before taking it out</li>
        </h3>
    </ol>
    <h2>Making the sauce steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>
            <li>Add red wine to the frying pan used for the beef to deglaze it. Boil down the wine while scraping off the meat juice</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce and mix with everything. Adjust seasonings to personal preferences</li>
            <li>Thicken with dissolved potato starch</li>
        </h3>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <h3>Put rice mixed with Umeboshi paste (pickled plum) in the donburi bowl. Place the beef on top and add plenty of sauce. Top with the finely chopped, cooked onions</h3>
